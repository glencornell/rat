%description
RAT is the premier open source voice-over-IP
application. It allows users to particpate in audio
conferences over the internet. These can be between
two participants directly, or between a group of
participants on a common multicast group. No special
features are required to use RAT in point-to-point
mode, but to use the multiparty conferencing facilities
of RAT, all participants must reside on a portion of the
Internet which supports IP multicast. RAT is based on
IETF standards, using RTP above UDP/IP as its
transport protocol, and conforming to the RTP profile
for audio and video conference with minimal control.

RAT features sender based loss mitigation mechanisms
and receiver based audio repair techniques to compensate
for packet loss, and load adaption in response to host
performance. It runs on a range of platforms: FreeBSD,
HP-UX, IRIX, Linux, NetBSD, Solaris, SunOS, and Windows
95/NT. The source code is publicly available for porting
to other platforms and for modification by others.
