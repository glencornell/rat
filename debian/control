Description: UCL Robust Audio Tool
 RAT is the premier open source voice-over-IP application. It allows
 users to particpate in audio conferences over the internet. These can
 be between two participants directly, or between a group of
 participants on a common multicast group. No special features are
 required to use RAT in point-to-point mode, but to use the multiparty
 conferencing facilities of RAT, all participants must reside on a
 portion of the Internet which supports IP multicast. RAT is based on
 IETF standards, using RTP above UDP/IP as its transport protocol, and
 conforming to the RTP profile for audio and video conference with
 minimal control.
 RAT features sender based loss mitigation mechanisms and receiver
 based audio repair techniques to compensate for packet loss, and load
 adaption in response to host performance. It runs on a range of
 platforms: FreeBSD, HP-UX, IRIX, Linux, NetBSD, Solaris, SunOS, and
 Windows 95/NT. The source code is publicly available for porting to
 other platforms and for modification by others.
